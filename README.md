# Lockjaw

Lockjaw is a fully static, compile-time
[dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) framework for
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) inspired by [Dagger](https://dagger.dev). It is also what you get
when jabbed by a rusty dagger.

Features:

* Compile time dependency resolution
    * Lockjaw makes sure all dependencies are fulfilled at compile time. The code will fail to
      compile if a dependency is missing, there are duplicated bindings for the same type, or if the
      dependency graph has cycles. There will be no runtime errors which are harder to detect.
* *Relatively* readable diagnostic messages.
    * When a dependency is missing Lockjaw tries to tell you why it is even in the dependency graph,
      and where the dependency cycle is.
* Cross-crate injection
    * Lockjaw is designed to be used across crates. Clients are able to inject bindings provided by
      libraries if they also use Lockjaw.
* Minimal generated code surface
    * While procedural macros are utilized heavily by Lockjaw, it avoids directly modifying the code
      the attributes macros are placed on. Only a few generated methods are visible to the user.
      This is especially important since most Rust IDEs today does not understand the output of
      procedural macros, a few extra type hints on `let` expressions is enough to make autocomplete
      functional.
* Optional binding, Multibinding, and generated components for plugin systems
    * Lockjaw allows [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)
      between library crates and their user. A library is able to define hooks for clients that
      depends on the library to inject. This is especially useful to test multiple clients using a
      library in isolation.

See [user guide](https://azureblaze.github.io/lockjaw/) for more information.

Example:

```rust
use lockjaw::*;
use std::ops::Add;

lockjaw::prologue!("src/lib.rs");

struct GreetCounter {
    counter: ::std::cell::RefCell<i32>
}

// Allow GreetCounter to be created in the dependency graph. These bindings are available anywhere.
#[injectable]
impl GreetCounter {
    // Marks a method as the inject constructor. Lockjaw will call this to create the object.
    #[inject]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self{counter : std::cell::RefCell::new(0) }
    }
    
}

impl GreetCounter{
    pub fn increment(&self) -> i32 {
        let mut m = self.counter.borrow_mut();
        *m = m.add(1);
        m.clone()
    }
}

pub trait Greeter {
    fn greet(&self) -> String;
}

struct GreeterImpl {
    greet_counter : crate::GreetCounter,
    phrase : String
}

#[injectable]
impl GreeterImpl {
    // Lockjaw will call this with other injectable objects provided.
    #[inject]
    pub fn new(greet_counter : GreetCounter, phrase : String) -> Self {
        Self {
            greet_counter,
            phrase
        }
    }
}

impl Greeter for GreeterImpl{
    fn greet(&self) -> String{
        format!("{} {}", self.phrase, self.greet_counter.increment())
    }
}

// Declare a module so we can do special bindings. These bindings are only available if the
// component installs the module, so different bindings can be used based on the situation.
struct MyModule {}
#[module]
impl MyModule {
    // When ever someone needs a Greeter, use GreeterImpl as the actual implementation 
    #[binds]
    pub fn bind_greeter(_impl : crate::GreeterImpl) -> Cl<dyn Greeter> {}

    // Called when a String is requested
    #[provides]
    pub fn provide_string() -> String {
        "helloworld".to_owned()
    }
}

// Components stitch modules and injectables together into a dependency graph, and can create
// objects in the graph. The component installs modules listed in `modules`
#[component(modules: MyModule)]
trait MyComponent {
    // Allows creating a greeter with the component. The created object has the lifetime of the
    // component
    fn greeter(&self) -> Cl<dyn Greeter>;
}

pub fn main() {
    // Creates the component
    let component = <dyn MyComponent>::new();
    // Creates a greeter.
    let greeter = component.greeter();
    assert_eq!(greeter.greet(), "helloworld 1");
    // Internal states of the greeter is kept.
    assert_eq!(greeter.greet(), "helloworld 2");
    
    // A new greeter has a new independent set of injected objects.
    assert_eq!(component.greeter().greet(), "helloworld 1");
}
// called after the last use of lockjaw to perform validation and code generation
epilogue!();
```

# Comparison with Dagger

Lockjaw Aims for feature parity with Dagger and uses very similar APIs. If you have used Dagger
before, lockjaw should feel familiar.
